OnTheFly is a sequence generator.

It composes a sequence of media fragments (only audio is implemented by now) based on a variable media structure definition made by the original composer.

This project includes:

* Core - the OnTheFly core.
* OSX - an vms editor for OSX. - in progress
* Traumbaum - an iOS app which can play a vms song.

revision history, or just diary:

may 9th 2013:
 For clarity, i have renamed objects (classes) named 'cue' to 'fragment', except it was really meant a cue.

may 8th 2013:
 Made a remote repository on github, the main reason is to make a online backup.
 Currently i am working on OSX editor ui. maybe the iOS target won't build.
